# Hunter-Seeker ðŸŽ¯

A local web application for tracking job applications built with Go, SQLite, and a clean web interface. Keep track of your job search progress without relying on external services or spreadsheets.

## Features

- **CSV Import**: Bulk import job applications from CSV files with flexible date format support
- **Status Management**: Predefined statuses (Applied, In Review, Interview, etc.) with easy updates
- **Visual Dashboard**: Clean interface with status filtering and application statistics
- **Local-First**: Runs entirely on your machine with SQLite database
- **No Authentication Required**: Simple local-only access
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose

## Screenshots

The application provides:
- A dashboard showing all your job applications with status badges
- Filtering by application status
- Statistics showing counts by status
- Forms to add and edit applications
- Clean, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

### Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd hunter-seeker
   ```

2. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

4. **Stop the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Data Persistence

Your job application data is stored in a SQLite database that persists in the `./data` directory. This directory is automatically created and mounted as a volume in Docker, so your data will survive container restarts.

## Manual Setup (Without Docker)

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- SQLite3

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd hunter-seeker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

- **Interview**: Applications in interview process
- **Offer**: Applications with job offers
- **Rejected**: Rejected applications
- **No Response**: Applications with no response

### Managing Applications

## Application Statuses

The application comes with predefined statuses:

- **Applied**: Initial application submitted
- **In Review**: Application is being reviewed
- **Phone Screen**: Phone/video screening scheduled
- **Interview**: In-person or video interview
- **Technical Test**: Technical assessment or coding challenge
- **Offer**: Job offer received
- **Rejected**: Application rejected
- **Withdrawn**: You withdrew the application
- **No Response**: No response from the company

You can use any of these statuses or mix with custom ones.

## CSV Import Format

For bulk importing job applications, use a CSV file with the following structure:

```csv
Date Applied,Job Title,Company,Status,Job URL,Notes
2024-01-15,Senior Software Engineer,TechCorp,Applied,https://techcorp.com/jobs/123,Applied through website
2024-01-20,Full Stack Developer,StartupCo,In Review,https://startupco.com/careers,Remote position
01/25/2024,Backend Engineer,BigTech Inc,Interview,https://bigtech.com/jobs,Phone screen scheduled
```

Download a sample template from the Import CSV page in the application.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Port to run the server on (default: 8080)
- `DB_PATH`: Path to SQLite database file (default: ./data/jobs.db)

### Docker Environment

The Docker setup automatically configures:
- Port 8080 exposed
- Data persistence in `./data` directory
- Automatic container restart

## Database Schema

The application uses a simple SQLite schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_applications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date_applied DATE NOT NULL,
    job_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    company TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Applied',
    job_url TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Backup and Restore

### Backing Up Your Data

Your data is stored in `./data/jobs.db`. To backup:

```bash
# Copy the database file
cp ./data/jobs.db ./backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Or with Docker
docker-compose exec hunter-seeker cp ./data/jobs.db ./data/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

### Restoring Data

```bash
# Stop the application
docker-compose down

# Replace the database file
cp your-backup.db ./data/jobs.db

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d
```

### Running in Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run with live reload (if you have air installed)
air

# Or run directly
go run cmd/server/main.go

# Build for development (outputs to bin/ directory)
make build

# Or build manually (avoid this - creates binaries in root)
# go build ./cmd/server  # DON'T DO THIS - creates 'server' in root
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build binary (recommended - uses bin directory)
make build

# Or build manually into bin directory
mkdir -p bin
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o bin/hunter-seeker ./cmd/server

# Or use Docker
docker build -t hunter-seeker .
```

## Sample Data

To quickly populate your application with sample job applications:

```bash
# Using the sample data tool
go run cmd/sample-data/main.go

# Or using the debug tool
go run cmd/debug/main.go add-test-data
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in docker-compose.yml or set PORT environment variable

2. **Database permission errors**
   - Ensure the `./data` directory is writable
   - Check Docker volume permissions

3. **Application won't start**
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs hunter-seeker`
   - Verify all files are in place

### Logs

View application logs:
```bash
# Docker logs
docker-compose logs -f hunter-seeker

# Or if running manually
# Logs are output to stdout
```

## Security Notes

This application is designed for **local use only** and includes:
- No authentication system
- No HTTPS encryption
- SQLite database with no access controls

**Do not expose this application to the internet** without proper security measures.
